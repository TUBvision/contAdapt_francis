Developments TUB

- Email from Alejandro
Same effects produced? Absolute lightness difference? 
Unsupervised algorithm learns two frequency bands -> used to estimate scene reflectance-illumination
-> averaged spectral range (gaussian) created -> convolved with original image -> feedback systems
-> output images

- Increased complexity of WI stimuli, included blurred edges, and inner patches
So far no particularly interesting results.

- Automated GIF generation in CANNEM model
- RENTIX Model?

- Remaking Noisemask generators to apply to models
how to relate D.O.G. bandwidth to spectral frequency. Gaussians not ideal. Explicitly filter whitenoise
rather than through a filter?

- WI adaptation vertical bars long -> appear to extenuates assimmilation as test patches merge with background

- Write seperate stimuli creator without the model slowing it down -> needs cleaning up


To Do List TUB
-------------------
- Noisemask generators, requires better understanding of explicity DOG bandwidth defintion.

This can also be achieved by profiling the original noisemask code in tandem written by
Torsten in MATLAB. However, DOG filters are thought to be physiologically plausible, therefore
it's worth working on this much cleaner noise mask generator for experience with this 
type of processing. After these are made, and the spatial frequency ranges of the noise masks
are with ranges used with the experiments on noise masking, then they will be applied to 
the models to test how they react, and where there is a specificity to their noise depedence
as observed in one of torsten & mariannes papers.


- Define direction of diffuse edges in WI

This is relatively exploratory and without firm theoretical underpinnings, but I want to look 
at how diffuse edges in WI will effect immediate perception of the illusion as well as how the
various models deal with diffuse edges in their computations.
