Developments TUB
------------------
- Email from Alejandro
Same effects produced? Absolute lightness difference? 
Unsupervised algorithm learns two frequency bands -> used to estimate scene reflectance-illumination
-> averaged spectral range (gaussian) created -> convolved with original image -> feedback systems
-> output images

- Increased complexity of WI stimuli, included blurred edges, and inner patches
So far no particularly interesting results - other types of stimuli?

- Context Adaptation in Checkboard Stimuli to observe changes in test patch lightness

- Automated GIF generation in CANNEM model

- Remaking Noisemask generators to apply to models
how to relate D.O.G. bandwidth to spectral frequency. Gaussians not ideal. Explicitly filter whitenoise
rather than through a filter?

- WI adaptation vertical bars long -> appear to extenuates assimmilation as test patches merge with background

- Write seperate stimuli creator without the model slowing it down -> needs cleaning up


To Do List TUB
-------------------
- Introduce FIDOs as post processing step in BEATS normalization process, to create more uniform output percepts.
		First try at this....heavy duty code.... maybe easier to just specify regions and avg. them
		Then once we have uniform values we can compare these across change in ellipse patch luminance.

- Apply generated noisemasks to Various models to test their "Edge noise" dependency

- Change stimuli in context adaptation code to make less context influences

- Normalisation method applied to many different scales of internal patches to create this GRAPH

- Define direction of diffuse edges in WI

This is relatively exploratory and without firm theoretical underpinnings, but I want to look 
at how diffuse edges in WI will effect immediate perception of the illusion as well as how the
various models deal with diffuse edges in their computations.

- General cleaning up and labelling of the code and removing old/excess code

- Write out justifications for other exploratory work involved and document the code
